<h2>The program is a PPSN (Personal Public Service Number) Validator.</h2>
  <p>It prompts the user to input a PPSN and checks if the format is valid based on a set of rules. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the program does step by step:</p>

<h2>1. Prompting the User for Input:</h2>  
The program asks the user to enter their PPSN by printing: Please enter your PPSN:.
The user then inputs their PPSN, which the program reads and stores in the variable userPPSN.
<h2>2. Input Validation:</h2>
Trims Spaces: It removes any unnecessary leading or trailing spaces from the input using .trim().

Length Check: The program checks if the length of the entered PPSN is either 8 or 9 characters. If not, it outputs:

<h4>Invalid PPSN - must be 8 or 9 characters</h4>
<h2>3. Format Check:</h2>
If the PPSN length is valid, it proceeds to check if the format follows this structure:
The first 7 characters should be digits (e.g., 1234567).
The last 1 or 2 characters should be letters (e.g., A, BZ).
The program uses the substring() method to split the input into:
firstSeven: The first 7 characters, which must be digits.
lastBit: The remaining 1 or 2 characters, which must be letters.
Regex Matching: The program uses the .matches() method to check:
If the first 7 characters match the regex [0-9]+ (only digits).
If the last characters match the regex [A-Za-z]+ (only letters).
<h2>4. Output:</h2>
If both conditions (digits and letters) are satisfied, the program outputs:
<h4>Thank you <PPSN> is a valid PPSN.</h4>
If the conditions are not met (e.g., wrong format such as missing digits or letters), it outputs:
csharp
Copy code
Invalid - you must have 7 digits followed by 1 or 2 letters.
<h2>5. Error Handling:</h2>
The program includes a try-catch block, although the catch block does nothing. It is there to handle potential exceptions (errors), such as when the user provides unexpected input or an empty string.
Example Usage:
Valid Input: If the user enters 1234567A, the program will output:

<h4>Thank you 1234567A is a valid PPSN.</h4>
Invalid Input: If the user enters 12345ABC, the program will output:

<h4>Invalid - you must have 7 digits followed by 1 or 2 letters.</h4>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
The purpose of this program is to validate the format of a PPSN, ensuring it follows the required structure: 7 digits followed by 1 or 2 letters.
